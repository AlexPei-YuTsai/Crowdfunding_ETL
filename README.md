# Berkeley Data Bootcamp: Project 2
> Crowdfunding Data: The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process

## Folder Contents
- A folder with the `.csv` files used for this project.
- A `.ipynb` Notebook file that uses the `.csv` files above in order to transform them into an SQL-compatible system of table schemas.
- TBD

### Installation/Prerequisites
- Make sure you can run Python. The development environment we used was set-up with:
```
conda create -n dev python=3.10 anaconda -y
```
#### Imported Modules
- Installing via the conda command given should give you access to all of the script's modules locally. However, if you don't have them, be sure to grab yourself the following libraries:
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)
  - The other imports you may notice are the Datetime and JSON modules. However, they are native Python modules and should have come with your Python downloads, no links are necessary. Any errors on that end are dependent on the machine's Python installation and pathing process.
